## Overview
You are required to develop a Java web application that enables two or more text documents to
be compared for similarity.

### Minimum Requirements are:

1. A document or URL should be specified or selected from a web browser and then
dispatched to a servlet instance running under Apache Tomcat.
2. Each submitted document should be parsed into its set of constituent shingles and
then compared against the existing document(s) in an object-oriented database (db4O)
and then stored in the database.
3. The similarity of the submitted document to the set of documents stored in the
database should be returned and presented to the session user.

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate my knowledge of the principles of object-oriented design, through the use of abstraction, encapsulation, composition,
inheritance and polymorphism throughout the application 

## How to Run Application
1. Install Tomcat Version 9.0 from the site https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi
